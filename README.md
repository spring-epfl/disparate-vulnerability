# Disparate Vulnerability to Membership Inference Attacks

## Datasets

ADULT dataset is checked in to the `data` folder. The TEXAS-50K dataset can be obtained by running
`make data`.

## Reproducing the experiments

To use the notebooks in the interactive mode, run:
```
jupyter notebook .
```

We rely on jupytext to automatically convert Python files to notebooks.

And run each notebook in the root folder. This will re-run the
experiments and might take up to 6 hours for a given script.
