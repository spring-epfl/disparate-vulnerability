# Disparate vulnerability experiments

We use Python 3, scikit and keras for training models, Jupyter notebooks for running experiments
and plotting.

## Setup

To install the required Python packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Files

What we do not need, but still remained:
* fbleau_wrapper is a wrapper for fbleau. Can still use it if we want!
* fair_dp.py is an attempt at reproducing a Fair DP algorithm, failed.


## Datasets

ADULT and COMPAS datasets are checked in to the `data` folder. UTKFace has to be downloaded and
unpacked into `data/UTKFace` folder.

## Reproducing the experiments

To use the notebooks in the interactive mode, run:
```
jupyter notebook .
```

And run each notebook in the root folder, setting `LOAD_FROM_PICKLE = False`. This will re-run the
experiments and might take quite a bit of time and memory.
